# hello-world
The first github repository of yours truely royrog!

Hello, my name is Roger. I enjoy doing project Euler problems. My strongest language is Haskell.
I spend my IRL time coordinating a Lecture Night with my friends, tutoring math, abolishing the wage system, and having decadent tea parties.
